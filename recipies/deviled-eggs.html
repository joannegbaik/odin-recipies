Mash egg yolks with a fork; stir in sour cream, mayonnaise, ranch dressing, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, and lemon pepper seasoning until yolk mixture is smooth. Stir in sauteed onions, bacon bits and Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Generously fill egg halves with filling and sprinkle each deviled egg with paprika. Refrigerate until chilled before serving.</li>
